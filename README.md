## Abstract 
 	
Breast cancer remains one of the most common and fatal cancers affecting women worldwide, with significant clinical, lifestyle, and demographic risk factors. Accurate prediction of breast cancer risk has the potential to aid early diagnosis and targeted intervention. This study introduces a two-phase statistical model to evaluate the relationship between time-evolving breast density covariates and breast cancer risk over the long term. By integrating Bayesian and Frequentist methods, the model captures individual variations in mammographic density across time, age, and menopausal status, assessing their predictive relevance for breast cancer risk. Data for this analysis were collected from Turkish hospitals, with each patient contributing five records spanning 5–10 years. Additionally, we developed an R package for power simulation tailored to ordinal longitudinal data to validate the model’s robustness. Results indicated that changes in mammographic density before menopause are highly predictive of cancer risk, while post-menopausal changes demonstrate reduced predictive power due to increased hormonal variability influencing density changes. This model offers a promising tool for identifying high-risk individuals and improving early breast cancer screening.
