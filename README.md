# Breast-Cancer

This is a study for TUBITAK: THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF TÜRKİYE.

This study consists of 3 main steps. 

- Converting the models in the following paper to R programming language:
  - Generalized Linear Model: SAS - [Paper-1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0006-341X.2004.00170.x?casa_token=PyIp_pGj4usAAAAA%3AOfdrERnx7z4iuzUGSGn8Znhehygbb6dvX411fjqIJXLAXEmgjaxoKNqCGfI6wY5RI-qqa0BVU4U-)
  - Two-Stage Log Regression: Matlab - [Paper-2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/016214504000000124?casa_token=dTIaCX02L30AAAAA:S8juI-4-Vgtfi0B5ksb7eUHdgAif9kSlEkCO9hqPX4fL0yPwwCSGmHaDlMNL9Zo3c27jDN9J6g)
- Integrate the two algorithm models together.
  - Theoretic
  - Through rogramming.
- Analyze the data from Ankara City Hospital Oncology Department to predict the long-term risk of breast cancer in women.
